brew install certbot
certbot -d motelligence.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly

Created account in clouflare and added motelligence.com to it.
Added txt record generated by above certbot command.
Also changed the nameservers of the domain provider to the ones provided by cloudflare.
After TTL time expiry, continued with certbot command and got a fullchain.pem and privkey.pem files generated.

I have produced initial certificates with --staged flag which produces fake certificates which would help to test if the certificates are generated.
Once you have the whole process working, remove --staged flag and produce the actual certificates.
